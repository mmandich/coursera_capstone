    "In this project, I will analyze restaurants in my hometown of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. A restaurant's success is often related to its ability to find a 'niche', but these niches can be tied to cultural and racial stereotypes. For example, people in North America often think that Indian or Chinese restaurants should be cheap. \n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis is important not only for understanding how racial/cultural assumptions shape our perception of food, but also for restaurant owners/investors. The restaurant industry in North America is extremely competitive, and it is difficult to become successful as a small business owner in this industry. Understanding what type of restaurant to open and where is critical to success. "

    "I will use the Foursquare City Guide data for the analysis. Data will include longitude, latitude, restaurant name, restaurant genre, price range, and rating. I will perform a brief analysis of the data to gain a sense of potential trends or shortcomings in the data. Then, I will use machine learning to try to predict restaurant rating based on the factors described above. The higher the explanatory power of these factors, the more critical they are to restaurant success.\n"
